# <small> About me <small>

I am a final-year PhD student currently based at the University of Toronto, where I have been visiting since 2023 after my supervisor, [Xujie Si](https://www.cs.mcgill.ca/~xsi/), joined UofT. I am formally affiliated with McGill University and the Montreal Institute for Learning Algorithms (MILA). 

My research interests include explainable AI, neuro-symbolic methods, and neural network robustness and verification.
