This paper proposes a novel robustness specification for neural networks. Unlike canonical specifications where pre-conditions are defined as constraints on the neural network input, the specification used in this paper are defined as particular activation patterns. The paper presents a strategy to extract activation patterns, shows how the specification can be checked with existing verifiers, and how this specification achieves better coverage of the test set.
